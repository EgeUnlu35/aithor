AITHOR E-BOOK READER - MID-PHASE PROGRESS SUMMARY

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Aithor is a modern web-based e-book reader application built with Next.js 16 and TypeScript. The application features complete API integration with a backend server for book management, user authentication, real-time reading, and translation capabilities. The tech stack includes Next.js 16.0.7, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Turbopack, connecting to a RESTful API at https://ebookapi-1xjq.onrender.com/api/v1.

COMPLETED FEATURES

1. AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
We have implemented a complete JWT-based authentication system with a dedicated login page. Users enter their email and password, which authenticates against the real API endpoint. The JWT token is securely stored in localStorage and automatically included in all API requests via Bearer token authentication. All pages except the login page are protected routes - if a user is not authenticated, they are automatically redirected to the login page. The system includes a logout feature with a confirmation modal that clears the authentication token and redirects users back to login.

2. USER PROFILE MANAGEMENT
The profile page displays real user data fetched from the API, including username, email, and account creation date. The user's avatar shows their username initial in a colored circle. The page includes a reading statistics dashboard showing total books, completed books, pages read, and reading streak. Users can access settings and have a logout button with confirmation. All data is fetched in parallel from the API for optimal performance.

3. BOOK LIBRARY AND MANAGEMENT
The home page displays a grid of all user books fetched from the API with pagination support. Each book card shows the title, author, file information, and upload date. When clicking on a book, users see a detailed page with comprehensive information including file name, size, format, and upload date. The details page also shows book statistics such as total pages, word count, and estimated reading time. Books go through processing stages (pending, processing, completed, failed) and the UI displays appropriate status badges. Action buttons for reading and translation are only enabled when the book processing is complete.

4. BOOK UPLOAD SYSTEM
Users can upload PDF or EPUB files up to 50MB through a drag-and-drop interface or manual file selection. The upload form includes fields for book title and author metadata. During upload, a real-time progress bar shows the upload percentage using XMLHttpRequest. The file is sent as multipart form data to the API endpoint. After successful upload, users are automatically redirected to the library where they can see their new book (which may be in processing status initially).

5. BOOK READER
The book reader is a fully-featured reading interface that fetches real content from the API page by page. Users can navigate through books using Previous and Next buttons, with disabled states at book boundaries. The reader displays the current page number and total pages, along with a visual progress bar showing reading completion percentage. At the top, book statistics are shown including total pages, word count, and estimated reading time. The content is rendered as HTML with proper typography and styling. The reader includes a settings panel where users can adjust font size (12-24px), toggle between light and dark themes, and control line height (1.2-2.4). Dark mode changes the entire UI including backgrounds, text colors, and controls. All settings take effect immediately and persist during the reading session.

6. TRANSLATION FEATURE
Books can be translated into 13 different languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish. The translation interface allows users to select a target language from a dropdown and optionally specify tone and style preferences in a text input field. When translation starts, a 5-second animated progress display shows three stages: analyzing the book, translating content, and finalizing the translation. After completion, a new book is created in the library with the translated title indicating the target language, and users are redirected back to the library.

7. NAVIGATION AND USER EXPERIENCE
The application features a consistent bottom navigation bar with five sections: Home (library), Reader, Upload (floating button), AIthor, and Profile. Each page has appropriate headers with back navigation buttons. The active page is highlighted in the navigation. All pages use a mobile-first responsive design optimized for touch interaction. Loading states show spinner animations during data fetching. Error messages are displayed clearly when API requests fail, with appropriate redirects for authentication errors.

API INTEGRATION
The application integrates with eight API endpoints: user login (POST /auth/login), current user info (GET /auth/me), book listing with pagination (GET /books), book upload (POST /books/upload), single book details (GET /books/{id}), book processing status (GET /books/{id}/status), book statistics (GET /books/{id}/stats), page list (GET /books/{id}/pages), and individual page content (GET /books/{id}/pages/{page_number}). All authenticated requests include the JWT Bearer token in the Authorization header. Data fetching uses parallel requests where possible for optimal performance.

SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION
All routes except login are protected and require authentication. The JWT token is stored in localStorage and validated on every page load. Unauthenticated users are immediately redirected to the login page. The token is cleared from storage on logout. All API requests use an authenticated fetch wrapper that automatically includes the Bearer token. Error responses for unauthorized access (401) trigger automatic logout and redirect to login.

CODE ORGANIZATION
The project follows Next.js App Router conventions with pages organized in the app directory. The lib directory contains reusable utilities for authentication (auth.ts) and API integration (api.ts). Components are separated into their own directory. TypeScript provides type safety throughout the application. The codebase uses React hooks for state management and follows modern React patterns with functional components.

DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
The project is version controlled with Git and hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/EgeUnlu35/aithor. Development uses npm scripts for running the development server (npm run dev), building for production (npm run build), and linting (npm run lint). The application uses Turbopack for fast development builds and hot module replacement.

PROJECT STATUS
All planned mid-phase features have been successfully implemented and are functional. The application provides a complete e-book reading experience with user authentication, book management, reading functionality, and translation capabilities. The system is ready for user testing and feedback. Future enhancements could include reading progress persistence, bookmarks and annotations, book search, collections, social features, and offline reading support.

CONCLUSION
The Aithor e-book reader successfully delivers a modern, feature-rich reading platform with complete backend integration. Users can securely authenticate, upload and manage their books, read with customizable settings, and translate content into multiple languages. The application demonstrates solid software engineering practices with proper authentication, error handling, responsive design, and clean code organization.
